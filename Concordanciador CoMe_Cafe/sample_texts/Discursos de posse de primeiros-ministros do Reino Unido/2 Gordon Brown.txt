I have just accepted the invitation of Her Majesty the Queen to form a government.

This will be a new government with new priorities and I have been privileged to have been granted the great opportunity to serve my country.

And at all times I will be strong in purpose, steadfast in will, resolute in action in the service of what matters to the British people, meeting the concerns and aspirations of our whole country.

I grew up in the town that I now represent in Parliament; I went to the local school.

I wouldn't be standing here without the opportunities that I received there and I want the best of chances for everyone.

That is my mission: that if we can fulfil the potential and realise the talents of all our people then I am absolutely sure that Britain can be the great global success story of this century.

As I have travelled around the country and as I have listened and I have learned from the British people - and as Prime Minister I will continue to listen and learn from the British people - I have heard the need for change: change in our NHS; change in our schools; change with affordable housing; change to build trust in government; change to protect and extend the British way of life.

And this need for change cannot be met by the old politics so I will reach out beyond narrow party interest; I will build a government that uses all the talents; I will invite men and women of goodwill to contribute their energies in a new spirit of public service to make our nation what it can be.

And I am convinced that there is no weakness in Britain today that cannot be overcome by the strengths of the British people.

On this day I remember words that have stayed with me since my childhood and which matter a great deal today: my school motto, 'I will try my utmost'.

This is my promise to all of the people of Britain and now let the work of change begin.

Thank you.
